# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System using Decision Tree

This project recommends suitable crops based on soil conditions using a machine learning Decision Tree classifier. The soil conditions include pH level and nutrient concentrations (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium).

---

## 📋 Features

- Decision Tree classifier trained on crop requirements.
- Predicts the most suitable crop based on:
  - Soil pH
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Phosphorus (P)
  - Potassium (K)
- Displays prediction probabilities for all crops.
- Human-readable tree output for interpretability.
